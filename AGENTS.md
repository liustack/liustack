# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

This is the **GitHub profile repository** (`liustack/liustack`). It serves two purposes:

1. **Profile README** — `README.md` renders on the GitHub profile page at [github.com/liustack](https://github.com/liustack). Keep it concise and professional.
2. **Shared resources hub** — Collects reusable scripts, docs, and skills shared across all repositories.

## Directory Structure

```
README.md          # GitHub profile page content
scripts/           # Shared utility scripts used across repos
skills/            # Agent skills (Claude Code / AI agent skill definitions)
docs/              # Shared documentation and references
```

## Conventions

- `README.md` is public-facing. Write in English, keep it clean and professional.
- `scripts/` contains cross-repo utility scripts (e.g., automation, data fetching).
- `skills/` follows the standard skill format: each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` and optional `references/` folder.
- When adding new shared resources, place them in the appropriate directory and keep naming consistent.
